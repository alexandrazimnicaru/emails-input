# Email Editor

## Install

Please make sure you're using node 10 or above.

The project has 2 index.html files:
- the one inside src is used for development
- the outside src is used to demonstrate how the lib can be used in a different project, so it's loading the css & js inside the dist folder

What I still need to do:
- Test in Edge & IE11
- Posibly use BEM for css instead of HTML tags as better selector performance
- Figure out how to load the CSS from inside lib instead of having to add it in a different project's html
